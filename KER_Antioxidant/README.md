**Effect of antioxidant supplementation on protein expression in Thoroughbred racehorses at pre-exercise time point**

*Object:*  
Determine the effects of antioxidant suplements on protein expression in Thoroughbred reacehorses.

### Filtering and Annotating Proteins
Normalized protein expressions were obtained from all five horses treatment and control diet at pre-exercise time point using Scaffold. Proteins not expressed in all of the samples including any technical replicate were discarded from further analysis. The script used for this step can be viewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NMDL-MSU/Differential-Protein-Expression/blob/master/KER_Antioxidant/Annotate_Proteins/AnnotateProteins.html).

### Differential Protein Expression Analysis
Differentially expressed protein between horses on treatments diet and control diet was identified in Scaffold Q+ using a repeated measures permutation test and FDR 0.05.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DE Analysis:
The scripts used to generate the summary tables of the permutation test can be viewed in detail [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NMDL-MSU/Differential-Protein-Expression/blob/master/KER_Antioxidant/Permutation_Test/Summary_Results.html).
